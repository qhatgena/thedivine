# The Divine

## Introduction

**The Divine** is uncontrollable number.

**The Divine** is one more security layer to protect your RNG contract, RANDAO,...from many kinds of attack.

**The Divine** is a smart contract which gives you **power** and belong to the void. No fees are required, you have to pay for gas cost and get the **power** (*unsigned 256 bits integer*).

**DO NOT USE THE DIVINE AS A RNG.**

## Concept

**The Divine** is a smart contract which was growing a **World Tree**.

**World Tree** is grown by **you** and **anyone** who is using this contract.

**World Tree** have root and it's **World Tree's** address.

**World Tree** is chained, one chain is created by:

* Previous chain value
* Sender address

## Why ?

* **The Divine didn't store anything:** To make sure that no one can read it own data. Anyone try to create off-chain simulates and read **The Divine's** data, they will read all invalid data cuz it is always change.
* **Previous chain value:** You are only changing it by change previous value, and it's impossible.
* **Sender address:** is adding value, user cannot manipulate it.
* **Branch:** is a piece from previous tree node, which decide the result will be calculate how many time.
